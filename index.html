            As the lead Software Developer at Southern Eagle Distributing, my responsibilities vary from maintaining IOT infrastructure to building quick turn-around business tools. The two key projects I've been working on include an application for predicting the future local beer market and making predictions on how much of a particular product should be ordered. Another project I've built is an SMS application using Twilio, React and the Azure Cloud to remove the need for physical devices among sales reps saving the company thousands of dollars.

            Advanced Technology International is a leader in collaboration
            management. We manage teams of large and small businesses, academic
            institutions, and nonprofit organizations to conduct research and
            develop new technologies for our federal clients. As a software
            engineering intern, my responsibilities include making additions to
            the front and back end. The majority of my contributions have been
            to
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alastar.com/">Alastar</a>
            , a tool built to increase awareness of complex situations to
            improve public safety operations and emergency response. My most
            recent priorities have been to test and add input validation to the
            forms that our clients fill out. This is to make sure that the
            passwords, emails, phone numbers, etc. are valid. I've also
            completed an ingestion that will run as a cron job to update the
            metadata of every running camera connected to Alastar on a short
            scheduled time.

          <p>
            MARS MapMaker is a client side ReactJS application that was created
            to work in tandem with
            <a target="_blank" href="http://cirdles.org/projects/mars/">MARS</a>
            from <a target="_blank" href="http://cirdles.org/">CIRDLES</a>. The
            purpose of this map maker is to allow geologists to properly
            register their rock samples with
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geosamples.org/">SESAR</a>
            (System for Earth Sample Registration) in order to aquire their IGSN
            (International Geo Sample Number). This is accomplished by providing
            a user interface which allows the user to map the various fields of
            their metadata to the corresponding field in the SESAR database.
            After the map is complete, a javascript mapping file is created to
            automate the process for obtaining the IGSN. This project is
            currently being tested by Columbia University.

          </div>
          <p>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> is a free
            and open-source learning management system written in PHP and
            distributed under the GNU General Public License. In order to combat
            existing bugs in Moodle, my team and I set out to produce a testing
            framework to help Moodle developers better identify some of the
            potential issues in their code. We designed the framework so that,
            if a developer is interested in testing a specific method within a
            class, they would have to do a few things. First, add a test case to
            the test case folder that follows the requirements of the testing
            template. After adding the test case, the developer would also
            create a simple driver in the "testCasesExecutables" folder that
            follows the driver template and voila! We wanted to build a
            framework that was both intuitive and made the testing of classes
            and methods easy.

            Squid 3.0 is the replacement for Squid 2.5. Its goal is to provide
            full workflow support for processing and interpreting Shrimp data
            outputs in the form of Prawn xml files and ‘OP’ files including:
            project, data, task, expression, visualizations, report, and
            parameters management. My partner and I were responsible for getting
            the project off of the ground through the use of containerized user
            sessions via docker and java servlets.

          <p>
            Capgemini is a global leader in consulting, technology services and
            digital transformation. Every year, the company hosts a national
            competition for invitees to demonstrate their abilities. Competitors
            were required to create an application that solved a particular
            problem statement. This included illustrating a plan of development,
            its architecture, a full business model, and a working prototype
            with some working code. Each participant had 72 hours to complete
            the project with their 5 person team. After winning the regional
            competition for the southeast, my team went on to win the national
            competition against San Francisco, Dallas, & New York. Click the
            link above to see our working prototype!
